movie list can hold up to 20 movies.

### 3. Create a Voting Session
Once you've created a movie list, start a voting session. Invite friends to the voting
session by sharing the lobby link.

### TMDb
The Movie Database (TMDb) is this app's primary movie data resource. TMDb's API powers
WeWatch's search and discover features, and it provides poster images and general
information for each result.
Notice: This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.

### OMDb
WeWatch relies on The Open Movie Database (OMDb) for supplementary movie data. WeWatch uses
OMDb's API to get additional information (e.g., runtime, ratings, and actors) for each
result provided by TMDb.
